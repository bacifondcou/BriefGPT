In this article, we will explain the main features and benefits of Fabulatech Serial Port Splitter, and how you can use it for various serial communication scenarios.
 
## What is Fabulatech Serial Port Splitter?
 
Fabulatech Serial Port Splitter is a software that creates virtual COM ports linked to a physical COM port. It allows you to access a serial device from several applications simultaneously, or send data to several serial devices from one application. It also supports full hardware serial ports emulation, which means that any application can recognize virtual COM ports as usual hardware COM ports.
 
Fabulatech Serial Port Splitter has three main modes of operation:
 
- **Splitting**: This mode allows you to split one physical COM port into several virtual COM ports. Each virtual COM port appears as an exact copy of the hardware COM port. Thus, several applications can exchange data with the serial device connected to the physical COM port at the same time.
- **Sharing**: This mode allows you to open a single physical COM port by several applications simultaneously. This is similar to splitting, but in this case the applications use the same COM port name without creating virtual COM ports. Thus, you don't have to adjust each application to work with a separate virtual COM port.
- **Joining**: This mode allows you to join several physical COM ports into one virtual COM port. In this case, data from each physical COM port is sent to the virtual COM port, and vice versa. This is useful if you need to send data to multiple serial devices from one application.
