# How to Set Up an Arma 3 Life Server
 
Arma 3 Life is a popular mod for Arma 3 that allows players to roleplay as different characters in a realistic world. You can choose to be a police officer, a civilian, a medic, or even a criminal. To play Arma 3 Life, you need to join a server that runs the mod. However, you can also create your own server and customize it to your liking. In this article, we will show you how to set up an Arma 3 Life server using the AsYetUntitled framework, which is an open-source and updated version of the original Altis Life RPG mod by TAW\_Tonic.

## Requirements
 
Before you start, you will need the following:
 
- An Arma 3 game installed on your PC.
- A Steam account with Arma 3 server package downloaded (free).
- A dedicated server machine with Windows Server 2008 or later or a modern Linux distribution.
- A minimum of 2 GB RAM and 32 GB HDD (SSD recommended) for the server machine.
- A stable internet connection with port forwarding enabled on your router or firewall.
- The AsYetUntitled framework files from GitHub.
- The extDB3 files from GitHub.
- The XAMPP software for setting up a local database.
- The PBO Manager software for packing and unpacking PBO files.
- The TADST software for launching and configuring the server.

## Installation
 
Follow these steps to install and configure your Arma 3 Life server:

1. Create the following empty directories on your server machine: D:\Apps\Steam, D:\Games\ArmA3\A3Master, D:\Games\ArmA3\A3Files.
2. Download steamcmd.exe from [here](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd.zip) and save it to D:\Apps\Steam.
3. Run steamcmd.exe. This will download and install the required steam files to your custom steam directory.
4. Create a file named #Arma3server\_steamcmd\_example.cmd in D:\Games\ArmA3\A3Files with the following content:

        @echo off
        set steamPath=D:\Apps\Steam
        set armaPath=D:\Games\ArmA3\A3Master
        set branch=233780 -beta
        set branchString=Arma 3 Server
        :: For stable use 233780 -beta
        :: For Dev use 233780 -beta development
        :: Note, the missing qotation marks, these need to be wrapped around the entire "+app_data......"
        %steamPath%\steamcmd.exe +login STEAMUSERNAME STEAMPASSWORD +force_install_dir %armaPath% +"app_update %branch%" validate +quit
        echo .
        echo %branchString% Installed/Updated successfully
        pause

Replace STEAMUSERNAME and STEAMPASSWORD with your own steam account credentials. You can also change the branch parameter to choose between stable or development versions of Arma 3 server.
5. Run the #Arma3server\_steamcmd\_example.cmd file. This will download and install the Arma 3 server package to D:\Games\ArmA3\A3Master. You may need to enter a validation code that Steam will send you via email.
6. Create a shortcut for the arma3server.exe file on your server desktop. Add the following parameters to the target line in the shortcut tab:

        -port=2302 "-profiles=D:\Games\Arma3\A3Master" -config=CONFIG_server.cfg -world=empty

This will set the port number, the profile directory, the config file name, and the default world for your server. You can change these parameters as you wish.
7. Download the AsYetUntitled framework files from [here](https://github.com/AsYetUntitled/Framework). Unzip them and copy the Altis\_Life.Altis folder to D:\Games\ArmA3\A3Master\mpmissions. 0f148eb4a0
